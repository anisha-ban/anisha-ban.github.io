      GPA: 1.0 (High distinction)

      Thesis: `Sequential Decoding of Convolutional Codes for Insertion/Deletion Channels`
        - Supervised by Dr. Andreas Lenz at the Chair of Coding for Communications and Data Storage (Prof. Dr.-Ing. Antonia Wachter-Zeh)
        - Dealt with efficient decoding algorithms for convolutional codes to correct insertion & deletion errors. We derived a new decoding metric to facilitate the implementation of sequential decoders for insertion/deletion channels and compared a sequential Fano decoder with a Viterbi approach.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Anisha! :)

I'm a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich in the group for coding and cryptography (COD) led by [Prof. Antonia Wachter-Zeh](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/lnt/people/professors/wachter-zeh/). Here's my [TUM webpage](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/lnt/mitarbeiter/doktoranden/banerjee/).

My research largely concerns coding for insertion and deletion errors, with a particular focus on DNA-based data storage.

Feel free to reach out!
