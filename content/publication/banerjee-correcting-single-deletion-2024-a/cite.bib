 abstract = {Owing to its several merits over other DNA sequencing technologies, nanopore sequencers hold an immense potential to revolutionize the efficiency of DNA storage systems. However, their higher error rates necessitate further research to devise practical and efficient coding schemes that would allow accurate retrieval of the data stored. Our work takes a step in this direction by adopting a simplified model of the nanopore sequencer inspired by Mao et al., which incorporates some of its physical aspects. This channel model can be viewed as a sliding window of length $\ell$ that passes over the incoming input sequence and produces the Hamming weight of the enclosed $\ell$ bits, while shifting by one position at each time step. The resulting ($\ell$ + 1)-ary vector, referred to as the $\ell$-read vector, is susceptible to deletion errors due to imperfections inherent in the sequencing process. We establish that at least log n - $\ell$ bits of redundancy are needed to correct a single deletion. An error-correcting code that is optimal up to an additive constant, is also proposed. Furthermore, we find that for $\ell$ $â‰¥$ 2, reconstruction from two distinct noisy $\ell$-read vectors can be accomplished without any redundancy, and provide a suitable reconstruction algorithm to this effect.},
